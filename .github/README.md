## Open Sourcing in the DoD

On June 2, 2016, the U.S Chief Information and Acquisition Officers released Memorandum [M-16-21](https://code.gov/#/policy-guide/policy/introduction), creating a Federal Source Code Policy. The goal is to improve the the cost efficiency, mission effectiveness, and consumer experience of government programs by maximizing the amount of federal software that is reused by other agencies or made available to the general public to improve. To help implement this policy, the websites [code.gov](https://code.gov) and [code.mil](https://www.code.mil/#/) were created to address the needs of general federal agencies and the DoD, respectively. These websites provide great resources on navigating the complexities of sharing code developed by and for federal agencies.
